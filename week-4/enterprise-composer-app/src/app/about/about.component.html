      Born in Austria in 1756, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is easily one of the most widely recognized
      classical composers of all time. A musical child prodigy, Mozart was playing musical instruments
      by the age of 4, performing in royal courts at the age of 6, and composing his first opera at age 11.
      His sister, Maria Anna, was equally as talented and the two played concerts together in such famous locales as
      London, Paris, Amsterdam, and Munich. In 1781, Mozart moved to Vienna and swiftly began to
      charm the local nobility. Soon after he married, and his first child was born in 1783. Mozart
      went on to father six children, only two of which survived infancy. Mozart died at the age of 35 in 1791.
      Rumors abounded that Mozart was poisoned by a rival composer, but in reality the famed musician most likely
      perished from a nasty streptococcus infection. Fun fact: Mozart had a strained relationship
      with his father, whose funeral he refused to attend. He did however, throw a rather lavish funeral for his pet bird,
      a starling. (<a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/547532/facts-about-wolfgang-amadeus-mozart)">Source</a>)
